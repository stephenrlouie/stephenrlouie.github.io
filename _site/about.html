## About

Steve is a curious software engineer who likes digging into the code and understanding how distributed systems work. He enjoys writing Go and hopes to contribute to more to Open Source projects. Professionally my focus is around CNCF technologies and in this I'm always looking to leverage / augment OSS instead of reinventing the wheel. Outside of work, you can find him Lindy Hopping in Boston or Providence, playing board games, or online playing something.
